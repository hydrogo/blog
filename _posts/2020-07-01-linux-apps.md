title: Apps I use on Linux
description: Which you may (or may not) consider suitable for you
categories: [tips&tricks]

I use Linux (Ubuntu LTS) as my primary operating system since 2015. Celebrating the 5th anniversary, I wish to share the list of applications (both standalone and web) I use on an everyday basis -- for programming, writing, and chilling. I hope you will find some of them suitable for you to get more work done. Los!

## Internet
* [Firefox](https://www.mozilla.org/en-US/firefox/) -- my default web-browser. Security, extensions, customization capabilities are the reasons to name it the must in available options.
* [Chrome](https://www.google.com/chrome/) -- some applications (usually developed by government authorities) are still optimized directly for Chrome. It is nice to have Chrome at hand for these (rare) cases.

## Mails
* [Geary](https://wiki.gnome.org/Apps/Geary) -- for my personal email addresses, I always use corresponding native web-services (Gmail, Yandex), all work-related emails go to Geary. Minimalism and great shortcuts rule. 

## GTD
* [TickTick](https://ticktick.com) -- to-do list manager. Fast, multiplatform, and customizable.
* [Notion](https://www.notion.so) -- a perfect tool to store all the stuff together in one place.
* [Google Keep](https://keep.google.com/) -- inbox for notes, which then go to the TickTick or Notion (or don't).

## Messengers
* [Telegram](https://telegram.org/) -- one love for messaging.
* [Slack](https://slack.com) -- work-related chats.

## Writing
* [Google Docs](https://docs.google.com/) -- paper drafts, reviews, official documents.
* [Overleaf](https://www.overleaf.com) -- powerful `latex` editor in your browser. The must for paper writing.
* [Notion](https://www.notion.so) -- notes, lists, thoughts.
* [VS Code](https://code.visualstudio.com/) -- for writing in the plain text of markdown. This post has been written in VS Code.
* [gedit](https://wiki.gnome.org/Apps/Gedit) -- lightweight text editor. A great alternative to VS Code on old machines (e.g., for my 6 y.o. laptop).
* [LibreOffice](https://www.libreoffice.org/) -- ugly, full of bugs, but sometimes useful for opening `.docx`.

## Programming
* [Anaconda](https://www.anaconda.com/products/individual) -- managing programming environments for `Python`.
* [Jupyter Notebook](https://jupyter.org/) -- interactive IDE for `Python` (other languages are also supported). Runs in your browser.
* [VS code](https://code.visualstudio.com/) -- I use the VS Code when I need to write `Python` scripts or develop libraries. Many extensions for VS Code have been developed to make software development easier -- linter, auto-completion, indentation, ssh-tunnelling, to name a few.  
* [tmux](https://github.com/tmux/tmux/wiki) -- life-saving application to manage multiple terminals.
* [screen](https://www.gnu.org/software/screen/) -- when tmux is unavailable on a remote host.
* [nano](https://www.nano-editor.org/) -- text editor that works in every terminal.
* [Google Colab](https://colab.research.google.com/) -- interactive cloud IDE for prototyping workflows that require GPU for feasible computation (e.g., deep neural networks).
* [vast.ai](https://vast.ai) -- service for renting remote hosts with GPU enabled.

## References
* [Zotero](https://www.zotero.org/) -- saves all academic papers in one place. Useful [tips and tricks](https://ikashnitsky.github.io/2019/zotero/) on customization.
* [Mendeley](https://www.mendeley.com/) -- I migrated from Mendeley to Zotero because of two reasons: (1) Elsevier is an evil; (2) Mendeley extensions didn't work correctly both for Firefox and Chrome. It could be an alternative if you don't mind the reasons above. 

## Drawing
* [Inkscape](https://inkscape.org/) -- for drawing vector graphics.
* [KolourPaint](https://kde.org/applications/en/graphics/org.kde.kolourpaint) -- Paint for Linux.
* [draw.io](https://app.diagrams.net/) -- for drawing diagrams (e.g., research workflows).

## Virtualization
* [VirtualBox](https://www.virtualbox.org/) -- for having WindowsXP and MS Office 2003 at hand (not a joke).

## Music
* [Yandex.Music](https://music.yandex.ru/) -- works in Russia.
* [Spotify](https://www.spotify.com) -- works outside Russia.

## News
* [Feedly](https://feedly.com) -- RSS client that aggregates news from [Habr](https://habr.com), [5.38](https://fivethirtyeight.com/), and other blogs.
* [Tweetdeck](https://tweetdeck.twitter.com/) -- web-client for Tweeter from Tweeter.
* [Telegram](https://telegram.org/) -- for reading channels (e.g., https://t.me/vsevstok).

## Utils
* [TeamViewer](https://www.teamviewer.com) -- the easiest way to connect to a remote server using a graphical interface.
* [Double Commander](https://doublecmd.sourceforge.io/) -- two-panel file manager for oldies.
* [DeepL](https://www.deepl.com/translator) -- translator powered by deep learning. A great alternative to Google.Translator.
* [Surfshark](https://surfshark.com/) -- VPN-client.


## Epilogue

I don't have any plans to migrate from Linux back to Windows or to macOS. I am happy and satisfied with the tools I mentioned above -- it is everything that I need to get my work done.
